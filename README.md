# Get Programming with Go
This is my code from following along with the Get Programming with Go book
by Manning publications. Each directory is labeled as a Lesson to follow 
the structure of the book. Lesson One you will notice is missing and it's
because the first chapter or Lesson in this book is about using the [Go 
playground](https://go.dev/play/) and setting up Go locally on your computer.
